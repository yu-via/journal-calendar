### Journal Calendar

1. Project Summary

This project is an interactive calendar with journaling features built with React. Users can select any date on the calendar to add, edit, or delete journal entries. Each entry is visually marked on the calendar with a green bar, making it easy to see which dates have journal notes. Journal entries are cached locally, so they persist even after refreshing or reopening the app.  

Key functionality includes:  
- Selecting a year and month  to navigate through the calendar.  
- Using the Today button to jump directly to the current date.   
- Clicking the Journal button to add an entry for today.  
- Adding or editing entries for any date via the calendar.  
- Using the arrow keys to move between entries once inside a journal.  
- Automatic persistence of entries through local cache storage.
